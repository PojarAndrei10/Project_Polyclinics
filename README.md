# Java Database App for managing activities in a chain of polyclinics
Along with one colleague,we created a Java application dedicated to a computer system for managing the activities of a chain of polyclinics.  
The application uses a MySQL database management system and interacts with it through a graphical interface. The functionalities that the software will provide cover operations related to employee management, the financial-accounting service and the management of current operations within the polyclinic (management of scheduled patients, completion of a medical report, issue of a tax receipt).
The application will be accessible to several types of users through a login process. At the same time, the software must also offer a de-login functionality, which will return to the login request window so that another user can use it later without having to restart it.
The application is available with several modes of use and different features: Admin(ex: CRUD operations),Super Admin(ex: CRUD operations with unique code),Medical Assistant(ex: view/add/edit report),Doctor(ex: view current day appointments/current day medical records/medical history/profit, add/edit medical report, add doctor's seal and signature),Human Resources Inspector(ex: view employee's current day schedule, add/view leave, employee search), Financial Accounting Expert (ex: view employee's current day schedule/leave/profit/salaries), Receptionist (ex: record appointments, issue invoice).
